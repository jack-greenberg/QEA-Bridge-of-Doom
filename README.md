# QEA Presents: The Bridge of Doom

*One brave robot defies all odds to survive the Bridge of Doom.*

*Narrated by Jack Greenberg*

## Huh?

The challenge of this project was to get the simulated NEATO (Roomba-like robot with two-wheel differential drive) to get from one end of a tight bridge to the other without falling off. This was accomplished using MATLAB's ROS (Robotic Operating System) toolbox as well as a lot of calculus.

[Here is a link to the video of the NEATO crossing the Bridge of Doom](https://youtu.be/FyuYOvEM_9E]). The robot is programmed to follow the path of the bridge and then do a little dance at the end. ​
